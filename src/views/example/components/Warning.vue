        Creating and editing pages cannot be cached by keep-alive because keep-alive include does not currently support
        caching based on routes, so it is currently cached based on component name. If you want to achieve a similar caching
        effect, you can use a browser caching scheme such as localStorage. Or do not use keep-alive include to cache all
        pages directly. See details
